# manga_scraper
You can scrape manga pages with these scripts from corocoro.jp and csbs.shogakukan.co.jp

# corocoro

This one is simple. Just copy and paste the js script in the "corocoro" folder to your browser's developer tools console in the manga viewer page. First you need to copy Step 1 script, after entering it, you can copy the second step. After entereng it, browse through the manga pages and when you're done, you can press to "D" key on your keyboard to download pages in a zip file.

# shogakukan

This is similar. There is only one js script with this. Copy it into your console and browse through the manga pages. After browsing, press "S" key to download the .json file. After downloading .json file, edit the manga.py with your .json file and destination folder paths then run the script. It will give you pages as pngs.
